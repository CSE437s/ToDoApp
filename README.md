# CSE 437s Week 2: Build a To-Do App

This assignment challenges you to design and build a simple to-do application using your chosen programming language. The app should allow users to create, manage, and track their tasks.

## Objectives:

- Apply user interface (UI) design principles to create a clear and intuitive interface.
- Implement effective data storage and retrieval mechanisms.
- Gain experience with testing and debugging your code.

## Required Functionality:

- **Adding tasks:** Users should be able to add new tasks with a title, due date (optional), and priority level (optional).
- **Viewing tasks:** Tasks should be displayed in a list or other suitable format, showing title, due date, and priority (if applicable).
- **Marking tasks complete:** Users should be able to mark tasks as completed, which could visually distinguish them from incomplete tasks.
- **Deleting tasks:** Users should be able to delete tasks they no longer need.
- **Persistence:** Tasks should be stored and retrieved from persistent storage (e.g., file system, database) so they persist even after the app is closed.
- **Hosting:** [Use Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Suggestions:

### Front-End

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** For building the user interface and handling user interactions.
- **React or Vue.js:** Frontend libraries/frameworks to simplify the development of interactive user interfaces.

### Backend

- **Node.js with Express:** A lightweight and flexible backend framework for handling server-side logic and API requests.

### Databases

- **SQLite:** A lightweight, file-based database that's easy to set up for small projects.
- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database that's simple to use and suitable for quick development.
- **Google Firebase:** Firebase provides a NoSQL database called Firestore, which you can use to store and retrieve your todo data. It also offers authentication services, which can be useful for user management in the future.

## Considerations:

- **User experience:** Choose a framework with a focus on building intuitive and responsive UIs.
- **Development time:** Pick a framework that matches your experience and project timeline.
- **Scalability:** Consider future growth of your app and choose a technology stack that can handle it.
